I am a 3rd-year PhD student in computer science advised by <a class="underline" href="https://blast-cu.github.io/mlpacheco/">Maria Pacheco</a>. I am an inaugural member of the <a class="underline" href="https://blast-cu.github.io/">Boulder Language And Social Technologies</a> research group and an active member of Boulder NLP.



<h2>Research</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Knowledge-Seeking</strong>: I am currently developing a new framework in which a model is taught to ask questions that explicitly increase the amount of information available within a given scenario. Initial test-beds include an NLI-inspired task and a task measured by difference in factual coverage. I further plan to perform similar human experiments to find any differences in the type of questions humans ask in order to increase their knowledge compared to those asked by a model.</li>

  <li><strong>NLP for Education</strong>: Applying the knowledge-seeking framework, I plan to run an experiment where students attempt to teach a model. The students will attempt to explain a concept to the model, and the model will ask questions about any portions of the explanation that fail to demonstrate complete conceptual understanding or that might be unclear to someone hearing the explanation. Ideally, the student will be able to learn from the experience of "teaching" the model, while the model will be able to better ask questions that present the student with questions that force them to think more critically about what they wish to explain.</li>

  <li> <strong>Multilingual NLP</strong>: I have recently published a paper which introduces a new task: generating cross-lingual explanations for idiomatic expressions. When language learners come across unfamiliar instances of non-standard language, many methods of finding definitions can fall short. Many systems will provide them with an definition in the same language as the idiomatic expression. This requires that the learner be familiar enough with the language to understand said definition, which is not something that can be guaranteed in general. We introduced this task in order to ensure language learners can receive accurate explanations that they are sure to understand.</li>
